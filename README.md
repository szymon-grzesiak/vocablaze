## üöÄ Overview

The objective of the Vocablaze project is to create a web platform for language learning that allows users to create personalized sets of vocabulary with translations, learn using the flashcard method, solve quizzes, and engage with language games. Users will also be able to track their progress and customize the app's appearance.

## üéØ Problem

Current technologies offer countless possibilities to facilitate learning and acquiring new skills. The proposed language vocabulary learning platform meets the needs of individuals seeking modern educational methods. Unlike other available solutions such as Duolingo and Anki, this platform focuses on interactive vocabulary learning through flashcards, quizzes, and language games (e.g., Hangman), while also allowing users to share materials with others.

* **Compared to Duolingo:** Vocablaze offers greater content personalization and direct involvement in creating educational material, rather than guiding the user through a predefined series of lessons.
* **Compared to Anki:** While Anki is an excellent tool for spaced repetition and efficient memorization, Vocablaze offers a wider range of interactive learning forms.

## ‚ú® Features

Here's a breakdown of key functionalities:

* **üìö Custom Vocabulary Sets:** Users can create and manage their own vocabulary lists with translations.
